Main Features

Sketch Input

Upload full sketch or composed sketch made from separate facial part sketches (hair, eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, jaw).

App can also take partial sketches and combine them into a full-face sketch using the Sketch Composer Network.

Image Generation

Uses your Pix2Pix-style GAN with:

Self-attention in generator

Multi-scale discriminators

VGG perceptual loss

Mask-weighted L1 loss

Feature matching loss

Converts the sketch into a high-quality photorealistic image.

Face Matching

Generated face is compared to a database of real face images.

Uses Dlib facial landmarks + Procrustes alignment.

DenseNet embeddings + cosine similarity for matching.

Displays Top 10 most similar faces.

User Interface

Built in Kivy for cross-platform support.

Simple upload, generate, and match workflow.

Results page shows generated image + matched real faces side-by-side.

Workflow

Upload → (Optional) Part composition → Sketch enhancement.

GAN generation → Realistic image.

Face embedding extraction (DenseNet) → Database search.

Display matches → Top 10 results with similarity scores.
